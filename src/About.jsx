Our digital innovations of today are on the cusp of redefining the banking paradigm of tomorrow. Federal Bank is continuously scaling up this mantra to reach out, meaningfully and impactfully, to more and more customers.

          Our performance is built on the bedrock of a solid foundation established by focussing on digital for the past decade. Our leading-edge digital capabilities make us a sought-after Bank in the neo-banking space. Launch of digital products and digital marketing initiatives marked a strategic leap for the Bank to capitalise on the new realities more effectively, translating into 86% share of digital transactions. Our strategy and commitment to grow a secured credit portfolio, to pursue quality over quantity while ensuring our liabilities continue to be organic and granular helped us deliver on our capital conservation theme. We had to make some difficult choices that were necessary to realise our ambition as we commit to accelerating progress towards the goal of being the Most Admired Bank.

          While we broaden our horizons and accelerate progress, we also focus on reaching India’s underbanked and underserved with our neo-banking partnerships and a purpose of ‘inclusive finance’. We are constantly innovating and deploying unique differentiators in our endeavour to transform small businesses across the country. The stakes are high for small businesses in India as they are the future and make up most of the industrial fabric in our country. We are co-creating digital enablers for these businesses, to make them more sustainable and efficient. Our renewed commitment to democratise financial services using hybrid digital instruments for small businesses and deeper geographies will narrow the digital gap and deliver tangible results soon. The right digital model of reaching and enriching the underserved will surely catapult us as ‘The Perfect Banking Partner’ for these entities. Along with these, we will continue to address pressing issues such as environmental sustainability and economic inequality, and these will be the crux of our governance goals going ahead.
